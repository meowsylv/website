# my website!!

Hi!! this is my [sylvend](https://www.github.com/papaproductions/sylvend) config!!!

Keep in mind that this only contains files that sylvend uses, which explains why i didn't include stylesheets and scripts and stuff (well it's not like they're private or smth u can just download em lol)

oh yeah here's [my website](https://www.papaproductions.cc) btw

My website hosts some art that's not mine, those being [my profile picture](https://www.papaproductions.cc/stuff/sylveon-cropped.jpg) and [this example image](https://www.papaproductions.cc/stuff/pridepfpmaker/example.png). If you know who made the last one, or if you're the artist behind any of these two and you'd like to have them removed, you can either:

- [Send a suggestion](https://www.papaproductions.cc/stuff/suggest.html),
- or you contact me through Discord (my username is meow.sylv)
